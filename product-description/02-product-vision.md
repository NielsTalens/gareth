# Vision statement
We help product teams build the right products and features by making business goal alignment unavoidable.
We achieve this by ensuring that every story naturally reflects the strategy, vision, user flows and user feedback inside existing and used tools.

## Target groups
- Product Owners/Managers
- Product development teams

## Needs
- Persistent traceability between strategy, delivery, and outcomes
- Two-way validation:
-- Strategy must justify work
-- Feedback must influence strategy
- Zero friction adoption, embedded in existing workflows and tools

## Product features
- Opinionated product definition conventions
- Automatic validation on change
- Feedback and scoring alignment
- Structured improvement of feature requests

## Business goals
- Ensure business objectives are explicitly embedded in every work item
- Reduce investment in low impact or misaligned features
- Shorten the feedback loop between delivery and strategic decision-making
- Increase confidence in roadmap decisions across product and leadership 

## Differentiators
Most product tools help teams document, plan, or track. Gareth enforces continuous alignment.

### Alignment is unavoidable, not optional.
Business goal validation is not something you try to do. It's something that the system enforces by default.

### Bidirectional validation (strategy is not static)
Strategy validates work and work + feedback validate strategy.
Business goals set the direction and the product + outcomes are the proof.

### Invisible product (not another new tool)
Gareth disappears into existing workflows.

### Opinionated conventions, not blank flexibility
Most tools brag about flexibility. That’s actually a weakness.

### Change aware, not snapshot based
You continuously revalidate alignment when anything changes.
