title: Product Charter
desc: this document defines how the product behaves, makes decisions, and protects its integrity over time.
---

It does not restate the vision.
It governs how the vision is executed.

---

## 1. Core Principles

Non-negotiable truths that guide all product decisions.

Each principle must include:
- What it means
- What it prevents
- An example of violation

Example structure:

### Outcome Over Output
Work must link to measurable impact.
Prevents shipping features without defined success criteria.

### Alignment Before Execution
Features must connect to strategy and user jobs before implementation.
Prevents reactive roadmap additions.

### Small Before Complex
Prefer narrow, well-defined functionality over broad, configurable systems.
Prevents feature sprawl.

---

## 2. Product Boundaries (What We Are Not)

Explicit exclusions to prevent scope drift.

- We are not a task management tool.
- We are not a reporting dashboard.
- We are not a documentation repository.
- We do not optimize for feature breadth.

If a proposed feature moves us toward these, it must be rejected or re-scoped.

---

## 3. Core Product Behaviours

How the product behaves by design.

- Requires outcome definition before feature approval.
- Surfaces misalignment between strategy, vision, and execution.
- Makes trade-offs visible.
- Encourages clarity over optionality.
- Defaults to constraint over flexibility.

This describes structural behavior, not UI.

---

## 4. Decision-Making Rules

How the product resolves trade-offs.

- Prefer removing ambiguity over adding capability.
- Prefer depth over breadth.
- Prefer explicit constraints over silent assumptions.
- Prefer measurable outcomes over narrative success.

If a feature increases complexity without increasing clarity, it should not be built.

---

## 5. Product Character

How the product should feel in use.

- Calm
- Structured
- Precise
- Intentional
- Serious but not intimidating

It should not feel:
- Playful
- Overly clever
- Gamified
- Chaotic
- Opinionated without explanation

---

## 6. Language & Tone

How the product communicates.

- Direct and neutral.
- Evidence-based.
- No hype.
- No vague motivational language.
- Uses clear, outcome-oriented phrasing.

Example:
Instead of: “Optimize performance”
Use: “Define the measurable outcome.”

---

## 7. Evolution Constraints

How the product is allowed to grow.

- Add depth before adding surface area.
- Remove before expanding.
- Every addition must reduce ambiguity or increase alignment.
- Growth must strengthen integrity, not dilute it.

---

## 8. Integrity Tests

Before shipping any change, ask:

- Does this strengthen strategic alignment?
- Does this reduce ambiguity?
- Does this prevent feature bloat?
- Does this increase measurability?
- Would removing this make the system clearer?

If the answer is unclear, the change should not proceed.
