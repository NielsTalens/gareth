# User Flow: Adding a New Feature via Product Description

## Actor
- Product Owner

## System Actors
- Gareth (Alignment & Validation Engine)

---

## Preconditions
- Product strategy, product vision, Jobs to be done and a product description are defined and accessible

---

## Flow Overview
- The product owner opens the feature validator page and inputs the feature idea. 
- Gareth agents will verify alignment with all product defining documents.
- Gareth will display the conclusions, the prove and ways to improve the feature if possible.

---

## Main Flow

### 1. Add Feature Description
- Problem or opportunity
- The Product Owner adds a new feature in the feature validator.
- The description contains:
  - Goal, context, user and ways to accept/test.

---

### 2. Detect Change
- The new feature proposal is extracted and queued for evaluation.

---

### 3. Alignment Evaluation
Gareth evaluates the proposed feature against:
- Product strategy
- Product vision
- Jobs to be done (if available)
- Existing user flows (if available)
- Product description

Evaluation dimensions:
- Strategic fit
- Vision consistency
- User value clarity
- Outcome orientation

---

### 4. Gareth Responds

#### 4a. Feature Aligns — Gareth Is Proud
- Gareth is clearly pleased with the proposal.
- Gareth responds with:
  - An explicit positive reaction
  - A concise explanation of *why* the feature aligns
  - Direct references to the supporting strategy and vision elements

**Example tone**
> “This fits beautifully. It reinforces our core objective of X and directly supports the user journey we defined for Y.”

---

### 5. Create User Story
- Because the feature aligns, the system automatically:
  - Generates a user story
  - Links it to:
    - Relevant strategy and vision elements
  - Adds the user story to the backlog
  - Tags the user story with 'validated'

**Outcome**
- Feature moves seamlessly from intent to execution
- No manual translation required

---

#### 4b. Feature Does Not Align — Gareth Is Unimpressed
- Gareth is visibly unimpressed.
- Gareth responds with:
  - A clear expression of disapproval
  - A precise explanation of what is wrong
  - Specific guidance on what must change to achieve alignment

**Example tone [refine. Maybe choose Gareth modes (positive, snarky, insulting?]**
> “If I really wanted a useless feature I would have created...”

**Outcome**
- No user story is created
- Misalignment is explicit and actionable

---

## Postconditions
- Every proposed feature receives an emotional and factual alignment verdict
- Aligned features result in backlog ready user stories
- Misaligned features cannot silently progress

---

## Design Principles
- Alignment decisions are explainable and traceable
- Gareth rewards clarity and intent, not volume
