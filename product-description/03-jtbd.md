## Job 1: Defining a Strategically Aligned Feature

### Core Job Statement:
When defining a new feature, I want to ensure it clearly connects to product strategy, vision, and user jobs, so that the work contributes to meaningful progress instead of adding functionality for its own sake.

### Desired Outcomes:
- Increase traceability from feature → objective → measurable outcome  
- Increase clarity of expected impact before development begins  
- Minimize features without explicit problem definition  
- Reduce ambiguity about why the feature exists  

### Emotional / Social Dimension:
- Feel confident that I am working on the right problem  
- Avoid feeling that I am adding “just another feature”  

### Current Frictions:
- Strategy and vision are abstract or disconnected from daily work  
- Work starts from backlog items instead of outcome framing  
- No structured alignment checkpoint  

### Importance (1–5): 5  
### Satisfaction (1–5): 2–3

## Job 2: Objectively Evaluating Feature Proposals

### Core Job Statement:
When a feature idea is proposed, I want a structured way to assess its strategic, user, and outcome alignment, so that prioritization decisions are consistent and defensible.

### Desired Outcomes:
- Increase objectivity in roadmap decisions  
- Reduce politically driven or opinion-based prioritization  
- Minimize time spent in repetitive alignment debates  
- Increase transparency in decision rationale  

### Emotional / Social Dimension:
- Feel equipped to challenge ideas constructively  
- Avoid conflict caused by unclear evaluation criteria  

### Current Frictions:
- Decisions influenced by stakeholder pressure  
- Lack of shared evaluation framework  
- Alignment conversations restart from scratch each time  

### Importance (1–5): 5  
### Satisfaction (1–5): 2–3

## Job 3: Protecting Product Focus Over Time

### Core Job Statement:
When multiple initiatives accumulate over time, I want to guard the product’s strategic integrity, so that it remains coherent, focused, and differentiated.

### Desired Outcomes:
- Reduce feature sprawl and scope creep  
- Increase long-term product coherence  
- Minimize roadmap dilution  
- Improve clarity of what the product is and is not  

### Emotional / Social Dimension:
- Feel that the product direction is intentional  
- Avoid feeling that the roadmap is reactive  

### Current Frictions:
- Incremental additions without holistic review  
- Expanding scope driven by edge cases  
- No mechanism to detect strategic drift  

### Importance (1–5): 5  
### Satisfaction (1–5): 2

## Job 4: Defining Measurable Success Before Delivery

### Core Job Statement:
Before committing engineering effort, I want to define how success will be measured, so that we can learn quickly and avoid post-launch ambiguity.

### Desired Outcomes:
- Increase percentage of features with predefined success metrics  
- Reduce post-launch uncertainty  
- Increase learning velocity  
- Improve accountability for impact  

### Emotional / Social Dimension:
- Feel prepared to evaluate impact objectively  
- Avoid feeling exposed when asked about results  

### Current Frictions:
- Metrics defined after release  
- Vague or vanity metrics  
- No clear ownership of outcomes  

### Importance (1–5): 5  
### Satisfaction (1–5): 2–3
