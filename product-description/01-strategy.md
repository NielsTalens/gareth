## Mission

Gareth exists to help the IT industry focus on building the right products — as small, intentional, and effective as possible.

We aim to eliminate feature factories and the accumulation of non-value-adding functionality in software products.

Gareth equips product professionals with tools and ways of working that protect strategy, vision, and core problems to solve — so they can spend their time where it matters most:

- Talking to users  
- Testing assumptions  
- Experimenting  
- Innovating with clarity  

---

## Core Strategic Pillars

### 1. Embed Feedback Between Objectives and Outcomes  

Make strategy, product decisions, and user signals continuously connected — not separate documents.

- Every feature must trace back to a strategic objective  
- Every outcome must be tied to measurable signals  
- Every decision must be inspectable and challengeable  

### 2. Make Product Outcome Measurement Inevitable  

Create systems where outcome thinking is not optional.

- Define outcomes before features  
- Link delivery to measurable impact  
- Make success and failure visible  
- Prevent shipping without hypothesis clarity  

### 3. Guard Strategic Integrity  

Protect product focus from:

- Feature creep  
- Sales-driven roadmap distortion  
- Internal opinion bias  
- Metric gaming  

Gareth acts as a structural defense against drift.

## Target Customer

### Primary

- B2B SaaS product companies (10–500 employees)  
- Product-led startups scaling beyond founder intuition  
- Product teams struggling with roadmap overload  

### Secondary

- Digital product agencies transitioning from project delivery to outcome-based work  
- Innovation departments in larger enterprises  

### Buyer Persona

They care about:

- Focus  
- Strategic clarity  
- Measurable impact  
- Team alignment

## Value Proposition

Gareth gives product teams a structured way to ensure that every feature:

- Aligns with strategy  
- Supports real user jobs  
- Fits core user flows  
- Is backed by evidence  
- Contributes to measurable outcomes  

Instead of asking:

> “What should we build next?”

Teams using Gareth ask:

> “What progress must we enable next?”

### Core Value

- Reduce wasted engineering effort  
- Increase strategic coherence  
- Shorten feedback loops  
- Create defensible product focus

## Success Metrics

### Product-Level Metrics

- Percentage of shipped features linked to defined outcome metrics  
- Percentage of features evaluated against strategy before build  
- Reduction in low-usage features after six months  
- Decrease in roadmap churn  

### Customer-Level Metrics

- Increase in feature adoption rate  
- Increase in outcome achievement rate  
- Time from idea to validated experiment

## Long-Term Vision

Gareth becomes the operating system for product integrity.

In the future:

- No feature ships without outcome alignment  
- Strategy, user problems, and metrics are structurally connected  
- Product decisions are transparent and explainable  
- Teams ship less — but achieve more  

The IT industry moves from shipping features to enabling measurable progress.

Product professionals reclaim time for discovery, creativity, and meaningful innovation.
